# The Enigma Machine
The Enigma Machine was a cipher device used by the Germans in World War 2 to encrypt their messages.

## History of the Enigma Machine
The Enigma Machine was invented by Arthur Scherbius (an electrical engineer). Many variations of engima came out in the 1920s after the German military adopted it for its use. 

### Breaking Enigma 
The enigma machine was first broken by Polish cryptanalysts. Marian Rejewski (a Polish Mathematician and cryptanalyst) used permutation techniques to find the results of the answers. Utilizing intelligence from the French and with the help of other colleagues, he was able to break the enigma code starting in 1933.
